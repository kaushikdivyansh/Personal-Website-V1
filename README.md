# Personal Website V1

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c606e4e5-c841-4621-9978-013de4e90e07/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/dk-personal-website-v1/deploys)

My first portfolio website I designed and built in 2019. I learned quite a bit about HTML, CSS, and Google Analytics. Designed and developed with a conscious effort to avoid using any superfluous frameworks like Bootstrap. Since then, I think my web development and design skills have improved immensely. 

Deployed on Netlify.
